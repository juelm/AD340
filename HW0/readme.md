My name is Matthew Juel.  Matt is fine.
I have a couple of app ideas that I would like to be able to implement.  One of them will require some machine learning,
and I come from a financial analysis background so I am also interested in improving some data science chops.
Technology backup plan:  Thank god for remote repos.  My plan would be to save and push often, but probably the most important piece of my plan would be to get things done well in advance, just in case something goes haywire right in the middle of a large task between commits.  
If I get things done far enough in advance I should be able to get a working environment up on a functional computer,
pull down my last version, finish it up and submit.
